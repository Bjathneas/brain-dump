# What is a Game Engine
Before we dive into why you might make a game engine, let’s clarify what a game engine actually is and what it does.

A game engine is the backbone of a game—the meat and bones that make up the entire structure. The core functionality of a game engine handles essential tasks like rendering pipelines, window management, physics, sound pipelines, input handling, and more. In essence, game engines let developers focus on the fun part: game design and logic, without the need to metaphorically shoot themselves in the foot dealing with low-level technical nightmares.

By streamlining these crucial systems, game engines save time and sanity, providing a robust foundation for building interactive experiences without reinventing the wheel each time.

# So Why Make One?
Now that we know what a game engine is, why the hell would you want to make one?

Because creating a game engine is like signing up for boot camp: it builds your low-level programming muscles, sharpens your understanding of complex algorithms and processes, and gives you full control over how you want your engine to run. Plus, once you've built it, you don’t have to deal with learning someone else’s engine quirks, limitations, or convoluted documentation—you’ll already know your own engine inside and out.

Sounds like a great deal right? Shouldn't everyone make a game engine?

Nope. Developing a game engine is *not* for the weak. It’s a time-consuming, soul-sucking task that will have you banging your head against a wall, staring into the void, and questioning every life choice. You’ll lose hours wading through lines of code, debugging complex algorithms, and scouring the internet for obscure concepts and implementations.

To put it bluntly, you have to be a bit of a masochist to take on an engine project. But if you’re up for it, the struggle is worth it. You’ll walk away with hard-earned knowledge, sharper programming skills, and a deeper understanding of how games work. In the end, you’ll be a better programmer—and maybe a slightly crazier one, too.
