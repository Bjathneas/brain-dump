## Overview
* What an Array is.
* Basic properties of Arrays.
* Implementing basic Array operations.
* Simple programming techniques with Arrays.
## Introduction
### What is an Array
An array is a collection of data stored in neighboring memory locations, as such Arrays have a finite allocation which is determined by the number of items stored in said Array.

Example of allocating an array capable of storing 15 integer values
```cpp
#include<array>
std::array<int, 15> int_array();
```

The use case for an array is when you need to store a finite amount of data, meaning that you are not looking to store more data than is defined in the arrays size

### Accessing data in an Array

#### Primitive Operations of an Array:
 * Writing data into the Array
 * Reading Data from the Array
	*Note: All other operations are based on these 2 primitive operations*

#### Writing data into an Array

Array locations are designated by ***N - 1*** because computers start their count at 0. Therefore the starting index is ***0*** and the final index, for an array that is the size 15,  is ***14*** *(15 - 1 = 15)*.

Example of assigning the item at index 7 to the integer 18
```cpp
#include<array>
std::array<int,15> int_array();
int_array[7] = 18;
```
#### Accessing the data
Example of outputting the item at index 7, which prints 18
```cpp
#include<array>
#include<iostream>

std::array<int, 15> int_array();
int_array[7] = 18;
printf("%d", int_array[7]);//Outputs 18
```
### Array Capacity VS Length
An arrays capacity is defined as the number of items an Array can store. For example:
```cpp
#include<array>
std::array<int, 15> int_array();
```
The Capacity of the array *int_array* is 15 because it can hold 15 items
	Note: Accessing elements at indexes that are Index < 0 U Index > Capacity - 1. Is known as a buffer overflow, which is a huge security vulnerability and should always be avoided under all circumstances as this could lead to exploits or even runtime_errors.
Array Capacity cannot be changed upon the creation of an Array, as stated before Arrays have a finite allocation so the data cannot be dynamically allocated.

An arrays length is defined as the number of items currently populating the array. For example:
```cpp
#include<array>
std::array<int, 15> int_array();
int_array[7] = 18;
```
The Length of the array *int_array* is 1, because the number of stored items in the array is 1 which is at the index of 7.
	Note: It is common for array implementations to initialize a base value in each index of the array, therefore you will get used to int_array.length() outputting the capacity and not the actual length of the array.
#### Looping an array passed as a parameter
Looping an array passed as a parameter can be done in multiple ways
1. Only the array being passed
```cpp
template<std::size_t Capacity>
int get_array_total(std::array<int,Capacity>& arr) {
	int total{0};
	for(int i = 0; i < Capacity; i++) {
		total += arr[i];
	}
	return total;
}
```
2. Passing the array and its size
```cpp
int get_array_total(int* arr, std::size_t capacity) {
	int total{0};
	for(int i = 0; i < capacity; i++) {
		total += arr[i];
	}
	return total;
}
```
### Max Consecutive Ones
Given a binary array ==*nums*==, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: the first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2
```
Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
* nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int max_consecutive{0};
        int current_consecutive{0};
        
        int nums_length = nums.size();
        
        for(int i = 0; i < nums_length; i++) {
            if(nums[i] == 1) {
                current_consecutive++;
                if(current_consecutive > max_consecutive) {
                    max_consecutive = current_consecutive;
                }
            }else {
                current_consecutive = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return max_consecutive;
    }
};
```
### Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits
Given an array ==*nums*== of integer, return how many of them contain an even number of digits.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [12,345,2,6,7896]
Output: 2
Explanation:
12 contains 2 digits (even number of digits).
345 contains 3 digits (odd number of digits).
2 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits).
6 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits).
7896 contains 1 digit(odd number of digits).
Therefore only 12 and 7896 contain an even number of digits
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [555,901,482,1771]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Only 1771 contains an even number of digits.
```
Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 500
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findNumbers(vector<int>& nums) {
        int nums_length = nums.size();
        int even_digits_count{0};
        for(int i = 0; i < nums_length; i++) {
            if(getNumberSize(nums[i]) % 2 == 0) {
                even_digits_count++;
            }
        }
        return even_digits_count;
    }
    
    int getNumberSize(int& nums) {
        int placement{10};
        int size{1};
        
        for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            if(nums / placement > 0) {
                size++;
            }else {
                break;
            }
            placement *= 10;
        }
        
        return size;
        
    }
};
```
### Squares of a Sorted Array
Given an integer array ==*nums*== sorted in **non-decreasing** order, return an array of **the squares of each number** sorted in non-decreasing order.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```
Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
* -10^4 <=nums[i] <= 10^4
* nums is sorted in **non-decreasing** order

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sortedSquares(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> squares;
        
        int nums_length = nums.size();
        //Square each index then place it into squares
        for(int i = 0; i < nums_length; i++) {
            squares.emplace_back(nums[i] * nums[i]);
        }
        // Sorts the array in ascending order
        sort(squares.begin(), squares.end());
        
        return squares;
    }
};
```
