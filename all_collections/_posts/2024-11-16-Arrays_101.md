## Overview
* What an Array is.
* Basic properties of Arrays.
* Implementing basic Array operations.
* Simple programming techniques with Arrays.
## Introduction
### What is an Array
An array is a collection of data stored in neighboring memory locations, as such Arrays have a finite allocation which is determined by the number of items stored in said Array.

Example of allocating an array capable of storing 15 integer values
```cpp
#include<array>
std::array<int, 15> int_array();
```

The use case for an array is when you need to store a finite amount of data, meaning that you are not looking to store more data than is defined in the arrays size

### Accessing data in an Array

#### Primitive Operations of an Array:
 * Writing data into the Array
 * Reading Data from the Array
	*Note: All other operations are based on these 2 primitive operations*

#### Writing data into an Array

Array locations are designated by ***N - 1*** because computers start their count at 0. Therefore the starting index is ***0*** and the final index, for an array that is the size 15,  is ***14*** *(15 - 1 = 15)*.

Example of assigning the item at index 7 to the integer 18
```cpp
#include<array>
std::array<int,15> int_array();
int_array[7] = 18;
```
#### Accessing the data
Example of outputting the item at index 7, which prints 18
```cpp
#include<array>
#include<iostream>

std::array<int, 15> int_array();
int_array[7] = 18;
printf("%d", int_array[7]);//Outputs 18
```
### Array Capacity VS Length
An arrays capacity is defined as the number of items an Array can store. For example:
```cpp
#include<array>
std::array<int, 15> int_array();
```
The Capacity of the array *int_array* is 15 because it can hold 15 items
	Note: Accessing elements at indexes that are Index < 0 U Index > Capacity - 1. Is known as a buffer overflow, which is a huge security vulnerability and should always be avoided under all circumstances as this could lead to exploits or even runtime_errors.
Array Capacity cannot be changed upon the creation of an Array, as stated before Arrays have a finite allocation so the data cannot be dynamically allocated.

An arrays length is defined as the number of items currently populating the array. For example:
```cpp
#include<array>
std::array<int, 15> int_array();
int_array[7] = 18;
```
The Length of the array *int_array* is 1, because the number of stored items in the array is 1 which is at the index of 7.
	Note: It is common for array implementations to initialize a base value in each index of the array, therefore you will get used to int_array.length() outputting the capacity and not the actual length of the array.
#### Looping an array passed as a parameter
Looping an array passed as a parameter can be done in multiple ways
1. Only the array being passed
```cpp
template<std::size_t Capacity>
int get_array_total(std::array<int,Capacity>& arr) {
	int total{0};
	for(int i = 0; i < Capacity; i++) {
		total += arr[i];
	}
	return total;
}
```
2. Passing the array and its size
```cpp
int get_array_total(int* arr, std::size_t capacity) {
	int total{0};
	for(int i = 0; i < capacity; i++) {
		total += arr[i];
	}
	return total;
}
```
### Max Consecutive Ones
Given a binary array ==*nums*==, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: the first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2
```
Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
* nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int max_consecutive{0};
        int current_consecutive{0};
        
        int nums_length = nums.size();
        
        for(int i = 0; i < nums_length; i++) {
            if(nums[i] == 1) {
                current_consecutive++;
                if(current_consecutive > max_consecutive) {
                    max_consecutive = current_consecutive;
                }
            }else {
                current_consecutive = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return max_consecutive;
    }
};
```
### Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits
Given an array ==*nums*== of integer, return how many of them contain an even number of digits.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [12,345,2,6,7896]
Output: 2
Explanation:
12 contains 2 digits (even number of digits).
345 contains 3 digits (odd number of digits).
2 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits).
6 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits).
7896 contains 1 digit(odd number of digits).
Therefore only 12 and 7896 contain an even number of digits
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [555,901,482,1771]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Only 1771 contains an even number of digits.
```
Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 500
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findNumbers(vector<int>& nums) {
        int nums_length = nums.size();
        int even_digits_count{0};
        for(int i = 0; i < nums_length; i++) {
            if(getNumberSize(nums[i]) % 2 == 0) {
                even_digits_count++;
            }
        }
        return even_digits_count;
    }
    
    int getNumberSize(int& nums) {
        int placement{10};
        int size{1};
        
        for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            if(nums / placement > 0) {
                size++;
            }else {
                break;
            }
            placement *= 10;
        }
        
        return size;
        
    }
};
```
### Squares of a Sorted Array
Given an integer array ==*nums*== sorted in **non-decreasing** order, return an array of **the squares of each number** sorted in non-decreasing order.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```
Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
* -10^4 <=nums[i] <= 10^4
* nums is sorted in **non-decreasing** order

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sortedSquares(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> squares;
        
        int nums_length = nums.size();
        //Square each index then place it into squares
        for(int i = 0; i < nums_length; i++) {
            squares.emplace_back(nums[i] * nums[i]);
        }
        // Sorts the array in ascending order
        sort(squares.begin(), squares.end());
        
        return squares;
    }
};
```
## Inserting Items Into an Array
Inserting a new Element into an Array can take many forms:
1. Inserting a new element at the end of the Array
2. Inserting a new element at the beginning of the Array
3. Inserting a new element at any given index inside the Array
### Inserting at the End of an Array
To insert an element at the end of an array, we must know the length of the array and then select the index that is 1 greater than the length. Keeping in mind that we do not go beyond the capacity of the array.
### Inserting at the Beginning of an Array
To insert an element at the start of an array, we will need to shift all other elements in the array to the right by one, then insert our new element to index of 0. Unfortunately this operation is costly as it has a time complexity of O(N)

Example:
```cpp
#include<array>
std::array<int, 15> int_array();
int int_array_length{0};

//Place some initial values into the array
for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
	int_array[i] = i;
	int_array_length++;
}
// insert a value at the beginning of the array
//shift elements
for(int i = int_array_length; i >=0; i--) {
	int_array[i+1] = int_array[i];
}
//add new element
int_array[0] = 17;
int_array_length++;
```

### Inserting Anywhere in the Array
Just like when you are inserting an element to the beginning of the array, we have to shift all elements starting from the index you are inserting to the right. Then you can set the index to the new element.

### Duplicate Zeros
Given a fixed-length integer array ==*arr*==, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.
	Note that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written. Do the above modifications to the input array in place and do not return anything.

Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
Output: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
```
Example 2:
```
Input arr = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,2,3]
```
Constraints:
* 1 <= arr.length <= 10^4
* 0 <= arr[i] <= 9

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void duplicateZeros(vector<int>& arr) {
        int arr_length = arr.size();
        
        for(int i = 0; i < arr_length; i++) {
            if(arr[i] == 0) {
                insertZeroAt(arr,i);
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    void insertZeroAt(vector<int>& arr, int index) {
        int arr_length = arr.size();
        for(int i = arr_length; i >= index; i--) {
            if(i+1 >= arr_length)
                continue;
            arr[i+1] = arr[i];
        }
        
        arr[index] = 0;
    }
};
```
### Merge Sorted Array
You are given two integer arrays ==*nums1*== and ==*nums2*==, sorted in **non-decreasing order**, and two integers ==*m*== and ==*n*==, representing the number of elements in ==*nums1*== and ==*nums2*== respectively.

**Merge** ==*nums1*== and ==*num2*== into a single array in **non-decreasing order**

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside array ==*nums1*==. To accommodate this, ==*nums1*== has a length of ==*m + n*==, where the first ==*m*== elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last ==*n*== elements are set to ==*0*== and should be ignored. ==*nums2*== has a length of ==*n*==.

Example 1:
```markdown
**Input:** nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
**Output:** [1,2,2,3,5,6]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```
Example 2:
```markdown
**Input:** nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
**Output:** [1]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
```
Example 3:
```markdown
**Input:** nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
**Output:** [1]
**Explanation:** The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
```
Constraints:
- `nums1.length == m + n`
- `nums2.length == n`
- `0 <= m, n <= 200`
- `1 <= m + n <= 200`
- `-10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10^9`
	Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?

Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {
        //merge the 2 arrays aka replace the last elements of nums1 with nums2
        int arr_length = nums1.size();
        for(int i = m; i < arr_length; i++) {
            nums1[i] = nums2[n-1];
            n--;
            if(n < 0)
                break;
        }
        //sort the array
        sort(nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
    }
};
```
